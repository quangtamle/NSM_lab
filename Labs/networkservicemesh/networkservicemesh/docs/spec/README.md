# Network Service Mesh - Specification Folder

The following folder groups all dedicated specification files used to describe new or specific features in the Network Service Mesh project.

For example, a single specification file consolidates all the content from:

* The specification file from Google Docs used during the implementation
* Any specific implementation details
* Example usages
* Configurations
* References to PRs and related issues.

When needed, the developer will copy and populate the provided [template.md](template.md) file based on his context.
